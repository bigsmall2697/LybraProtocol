# Introduction to the Lybra Protocol

Lybra Finance is a groundbreaking DeFi protocol focused on bringing stability to the volatile cryptocurrency market through its innovative stablecoin, eUSD.
Built on LSD/LST's, the protocol initially utilizes Lido Finance-issued stETH as its primary components and plans to support additional LST's in the upcoming V2.

eUSD is an omnichain LSD/LST-based stablecoin solution. Lybra has been capitalizing on the fresh avenues ushered in by LSD/LST's to offer the world's first interest-bearing stablecoin. In doing so, it is creating exactly the kind of profit-generating utility that LSD/LST's need to start fulfilling their vast potential.

With the rollout of V2, Lybra will be introducing peUSD into its ecosystem. Consider peUSD as the DeFi-optimized version of eUSD. It's designed to be bridged to any supported L2's, without any constraints on liquidity.
